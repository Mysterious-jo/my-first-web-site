      JavaScript is an object-based scripting programming language. The language is primarily used within web browsers, and has the ability to access built-in objects in other applications. It is also used in server programming, such as in runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, first under the name Mocha, later as LiveScript, and eventually as JavaScript. While JavaScript has some syntax similarities to Sun Microsystems' Java, this is because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and there is a weak direct connection between Java and JavaScript. Other than the name and syntax, it has more similarities to Self and Scheme than Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specification of ECMAScript and was natively supported by most browsers until ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but after ECMAScript 6 it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.
